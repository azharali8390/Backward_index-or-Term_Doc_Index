# Backward_index-or-Term_Doc_Index
This assignment is implemented by using output file of previous assignment that is doc_index.txt.
I implemented it using Built in HASHMAP so it gets executed in max 1 minute.
It generates two outputs.txt one is inverse index and the other one is info.txt.
In info.txt byte addresss of each term plus in how many docs it touch and its total count.
Test.java is the driver class and from here I make a call to making_inverseIndex class.
